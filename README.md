# AnyTray
This is a windows oriented response to https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar

Notes:
 * This took me an hour.
 * I threw it together without regard for how clean it is.
 * The icons don't look that good. We'll replace them with better ones later.
 * Semi-random ports will come later. Right now it searches sequentially from 1738

Pull requests are appreciated. :)
