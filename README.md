# AnyTray
This is a windows oriented response to https://github.com/tonsky/AnyBar

Notes:
 * This took me an hour.
 * I threw it together without regard for how clean it is.
 * I borrowed the icons from AnyBar's GitHub page.
 * The icons don't look good. I WILL replace them.
 * you CAN NOT open more than one instance at a time yet.
 * Semi-random ports will come later.

Pull requests are appreciated. :)
